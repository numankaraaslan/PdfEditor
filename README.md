# PdfEditor

This is an example project to show how to use apache pdfbox library with JavaFX.

It is probably full of bugs and unoptimized code but there are examples of adding an image on a page, drawing a colored text with size on a page, drawing a rectangle with varying thickness and colors on a page, rotation a page and zooming in and out of the pdf file in a scrollview. You can also save your edited pdf to a file.

If requested, i mght try to add new functionalities too.

The project is a Maven project. You can easily run it with your IDE that can open maven projects.
