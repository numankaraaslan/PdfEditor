# PdfEditor

This is an example project to show how to use apache pdfbox library with JavaFX.

It is probably full of bugs and unoptimized code but there are examples of adding an image on a page, drawing a text on a page and zooming in and out of the pdf file in a scrollview.

If requested, i mght try to add new functionalities too.

The project is a Netbeans JavaFX project with Java 1.8.

If you try to open with another ide, u must download pdfbox-2.0.11 and fontbox-2.0.11 and apache commons logging libraries and include them as libraries in your project.
